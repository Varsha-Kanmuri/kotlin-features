# kotlin-features
Working on some cool features of Kotlin and how it compares with Java .

###1) Printing in Kotlin 
      - Reduces a lot of boiler plate code
      - Internally calling System.out.println()

                                                              |
                                                              |
                                                              |

###2) Declaring variables 
     - Variables are declared using 'val' or 'var' , provided they are immutable or mutable.
     - Java uses additional 'final' keyword to make variables immutable
     - Advantages using 'val' : Concise , predictable behavior, thread safety

                                                              |
                                                              |
                                                              |

###3) String Templates
     - Like Java, strings are immutable in Kotlin
     - Use val keyword to declare strings
